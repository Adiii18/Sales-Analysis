Order ID: Unique identifier for each order.
Product: Name of the product sold.
Quantity Ordered: Quantity of the product ordered.
Price Each: Price per unit of the product.
Order Date: Date when the order was placed.
Purchase Address: Address where the product was purchased.
Tools and Technologies
Python: Programming language used for data analysis.
Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis library.
NumPy: Library for numerical computations.
Matplotlib: Library for data visualization.
Seaborn: Library for statistical data visualization.


#Analysis
The analysis involves the following steps:

#Data Loading and Preprocessing:

Merge the 12 months of sales data into a single CSV file.
Clean and preprocess the data for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
